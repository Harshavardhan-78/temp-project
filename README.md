# 🍽 Smart Canteen Management Decision Support System (SCMDSS)

An web application that assists canteen owners in predicting food demand, optimizing menu planning, and reducing food wastage using Machine Learning and data analytics.

---

## 📌 Overview

The Smart Canteen Management Decision Support System (SCMDSS) is designed to support data-driven decision-making in institutional canteens. The system collects structured weekly sales data, learns from historical trends, predicts future demand, and provides actionable recommendations.

Instead of relying on guesswork, canteen owners can use analytical insights to prepare food more accurately and efficiently.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Canteen owners typically estimate food preparation manually. This results in:

* Over-preparation leading to food wastage
* Under-preparation causing shortages
* Poor inventory planning
* Financial inefficiencies

SCMDSS addresses these issues by analyzing past sales along with contextual factors such as weather and exams to predict future demand levels.
